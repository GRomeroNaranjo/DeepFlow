# DeepFlow

# Introduction
DeepFlow is an easy-to-use deep learning library optimized to simplicity. DeepFlow is a light-weight library that yet has many modules to implement. None the less, DeepFlow has managed to implement their first strong produt; a feedforward neural network. 

(NOTE: DeepFlow is still under construction and is yet not available for the public through pypi. Currently implementing Convolutional Neural Networks, Recurrent Neural Networks, Deep Dreaming, Pretrained Language Models and LSTM Neural Networks)

On Mnist the DeepFlow feed forward neural network is reaching approximately:
- 0.92 after 1 epoch.
- 0.96 after 2 epochs.
- 0.97 after three epochs.
- 1.0 on training data after 20 - 25 epochs.

The accumulation of these factors evidently articulate the strength and potential of the model.
