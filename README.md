# DeepFlow
DeepFlow is an easy to use Deep Learning library optimized to simplicity. Information: (DeepFlow is still under construction and is yet not available for the public through pypi. Currently implementing Convolutional Neural Networks, Recurrent Neural Networks, Deep Dreaming, and Pretrained Language Models), 

On Mnist the DeepFlow feed forward neural network is reaching approximately:
- 0.92 after 1 epoch.
- 0.96 after 2 epochs.
- 0.97 after three epochs.
- 1.0 on training data after 20 - 25 epochs.

The accumulation of these factors evidently articulate the strength and potential of the model.
