# DeepFlow
DeepFlow is an easy to use Deep Learning library optimized to simplicity. Information: (DeepFlow is still under construction and is yet not available for the public through pypi. Currently implementing Convolutional Neural Networks, Recurrent Neural Networks, Deep Dreaming, and Pretrained Language Models), (FNN is currently getting, 0.92 after 1 epoch, 0.96 after 2 epochs, and 97 after three epochs. It is reaching 1.0 on training data after 20 - 25)
